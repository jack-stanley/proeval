Slash GenAI evaluation costs by up to 100x while actively discovering model failure patterns to guide better AI development.

1. 💰 **Cut GenAI eval costs up to 100×** — achieve ±1% accuracy with a fraction of the samples
2. 🔍 **Discover failure cases** — proactively surface diverse bugs under strict evaluation budgets
3. 🧠 **Transfer learning over benchmarks** — pre-trained GP surrogates generalize to new models instantly
4. 🧩 **Easy Integration** - Easily to integrate into the GenAI evaluation systems with different modalities
5. ✅ **Validated on reasoning, safety & classification** — GSM8K, MMLU, StrategyQA, Jigsaw, and more

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from proeval import BQPriorSampler, LLMPredictor, DATASET_CONFIGS
from proeval.sampler import load_predictions, extract_model_predictions
import numpy as np

# Estimate a model's error rate with ~1% of the data
sampler = BQPriorSampler(noise_variance=0.3)
result = sampler.sample(predictions="svamp", target_model="gemini25_flash", budget=50)

# Compare against the true error rate
df = load_predictions("svamp")
pred_matrix, model_names = extract_model_predictions(df)
true_mean = np.mean(pred_matrix[:, model_names.index("gemini25_flash")])

print(f"Estimated error rate: {result.estimates[-1]:.4f}")
print(f"MAE: {result.mae(true_mean):.4f}")
```

## Experiments

Here is an example of how to run the experiments:

```shell
# BQ performance estimation (runs BQ-SF, BQ-RPF, etc.)
python -m experiment.exp_performance_estimation --dataset svamp --n-runs 5
```

You can find the comprehensive [experiment details](./experiment/README.md) and dataset settings [here](./data/README.md).
